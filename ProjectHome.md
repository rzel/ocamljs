**NB: this repository is obsolete; current development is at http://github.com/jaked/ocamljs**

Ocamljs compiles OCaml to Javascript. It uses the standard OCaml front-end, so the full language is supported (the object system is partially supported, should be fixed soon).

Included are several libraries for Web programming, as well as a library for working with Javascript via Camlp4. It works with [orpc](http://code.google.com/p/orpc2/) for RPC over HTTP, and with [froc](http://code.google.com/p/froc/) for functional reactive browser programming.

Ocamljs is developed at [Skydeck](http://skydeck.com/) by Jake Donham, with contributions from Mike Wells and Haoyang Wang. We hope you will find it useful.
